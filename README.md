# Rule-Driven-Technical-Support-Case-Management-System

Overview

A CLI-based Technical Support Case Management System built using Python to simulate real-world L1/L2 support workflows.
The project focuses on structured troubleshooting, priority assignment, and ticket lifecycle management using rule-driven logic instead of hardcoded flows.

Key Features

1. Support case creation with unique Case ID
2. Issue categorization (Network, Application, Performance, Security)
3. Rule-driven troubleshooting engine
4. Priority assignment (P1–P4) with escalation logic
5. Ticket state management (Open, In Progress, Escalated, Resolved)
6. Case logging and searchable history

Technical Highlights

1. Configurable, rule-based decision logic
2. Priority scoring and escalation handling
3. Clean CLI-based interaction
4. Uses only Python standard libraries


🏁 Summary

This project demonstrates how rule-based logic and automation can improve technical support efficiency while reflecting real-world service desk operations.
